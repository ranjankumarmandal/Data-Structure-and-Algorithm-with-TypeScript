/*
Q. Why frequency counter pattern?
-  It uses objects or sets to collect values / frequencies of values. I helps to avoid O(n ^ 2) and gives solution only in O(n).

// Problem - 2 arrays given, where 2nd containes the same value but squared with the 1st one. [hint - same frequency is going to be there]
