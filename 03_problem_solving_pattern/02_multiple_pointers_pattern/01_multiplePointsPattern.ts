// Definition - Creting pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the begining, end or middle based on a certain condition.
// - Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space ompleity as well

// problem - write a function which accepts a sorted array of integers. It should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefindd if a pair does not exist.
